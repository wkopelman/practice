      <h2>Processor and Memory</h2>

      <p>The heart of the computer is a Motorola 68000 microprocessor running at 7.8336 <abbr title="megahertz">MHz</abbr>, connected to 128 <abbr title="kilobytes">KB</abbr> <abbr title="random access memory">RAM</abbr> shared by the processor and the display controller.</p>

      <h2>Peripherals</h2>

      <p>The built-in display is a one-bit, black-and-white, 9-inch (23 cm) CRT with a fixed resolution of 512 x 342 pixels, establishing the desktop publishing standard of 72 <abbr title="pixels per square inch">PPI</abbr>.</p>

      <p>An external floppy disk drive can be added using a proprietary connector. The keyboard and mouse use simple proprietary protocols, allowing some third-party upgrades.</p>

      <h2>Storage</h2>

      <p>The Macintosh contains a single 400 KB, single-sided 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-inch floppy disk drive, dedicating no space to other internal mechanical storage. The Mac <abbr title="operating system">OS</abbr> was disk-based from the beginning, as RAM had to be conserved, but this "Startup Disk" could still be temporarily ejected. One floppy disk was sufficient to store the System Software, an application and the data files created with the application.</p>
